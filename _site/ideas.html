That means that at any given time, either a person's workspace or their home is being used. Can we make a more efficient use of this space by combining both?

I have been envisioning local warehouses where people can long-term store their stuff (e.g. a pair of shoes they don't want anymore) that would be paired with an online searchable database (like eBay).  Then, a customer can come in to the warehouse and ask to see a certain item, and then pay the attendant to carry it out right then.  Would only work locally.</div>
