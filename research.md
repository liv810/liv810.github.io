## Research

* A Scale-Based Sensitivity Analysis for Difference-in-Differences (2020). Forthcoming.  
<sup>**Olivia Angiuli**, Benjamin Lu, Peng Ding</sup>  
<u>Summary:</u> We evaluate the scale-dependent causal inference procedure, difference-in-differences, under many different scales to produce a range of effect estimates that holds if any one of those scales holds.

* [Minimizing State Preparations in Variational Quantum Eigensolver by Partitioning into Commuting Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13623) (2019).  
<sup><sup>Pranav Gokhale, **Olivia Angiuli**, Yongshan Ding, Kaiwen Gui, Teague Tomesh, Martin Suchara, Margaret Martonosi, Frederic T. Chong</sup></sup>  
<u>Summary:</u> We exploit simultaneous measurability in order to speed up a quantum algorithm VQE, which finds the lowest eigenvalue of an exponentially sized matrix, by 8-30x.

* [How to De-Identify Your Data](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2838930). Communications of the ACM (2015).  
<sup>**Olivia Angiuli**, Joe Blitzstein, Jim Waldo</sup>  
<u>Summary:</u> We demonstrate that de-identifying datasets via k-anonymization leads to statistical distortion of an educational data set, since the individuals with the most identity-revealing traits also tend to be outliers in terms of educational performance and engagement.

* [Statistical Tradeoffs between Generalization and Suppression in the De-Identification of Large-Scale Data Sets](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7552278/). IEEE Computer Society Intl Conference on Computers, Software & Applications (2016).  
<sup>**Olivia Angiuli**, Jim Waldo</sup>  
<u>Summary:</u> We introduce improvements to two techniques used to achieve k-anonymity, generalization and suppression, that confer k-anonymity while better preserving the statistical properties of an educational data set.

* [Upvote Dynamics on the Quora Network](https://www.quora.com/q/quoradata/Upvote-Dynamics-on-the-Quora-Network). Joint Statistical Meeting (2016).  
<sup>Shankar Iyer, Paula Griffin, and **Olivia Angiuli**</sup>  
<u>Summary:</u> We explore the propagation of content on Quora along users' follower networks, demonstrating the noticeable role that the underlying network plays in social Internet products.

* [Elite Controller CD8+ T Cells Exhibit Comparable Viral Inhibition Capacity but Better Sustained Effector Properties Compared to Chronic Progressors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27406996). Journal of Leukocyte Biology (2016).  
<sup><sup>David Shasha, Dan Karel, **Olivia Angiuli**, Adam Greenblatt, Musie Ghebremichael, Xu Yu, Filippos Porichis, and Bruce Walker</sup></sup>  
<u>Summary:</u> We show that the immune cells of a small group of HIV-positive individuals who can naturally suppress HIV the virus without treatment (_elite controllers_) show superior ability to continue to suppress HIV development even when extracted out of the body for 3 days.
