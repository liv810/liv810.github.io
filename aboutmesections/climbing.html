I've been climbing since Winter 2015, primarily bouldering and leading indoors.

<p>I document some of my adventures on <a href="https://instagram.com/olivialalalala/">Instagram</a>, and you can check out my <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/user/200281900/olivia-angiuli">Mountain Project</a> for my outdoor climbing log. </p>

<p>If you're curious what a climbing trip looks like, check a recap of our trip to Joshua Tree over Thanksgiving 2018:</p>
