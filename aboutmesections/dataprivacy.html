I've published two papers in the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity">k-anonymity</a>, addressing the tradeoff between making datasets private and useful.

<p> The first one was the <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2838930">front page article</a> of the Communications of the ACM and addressed the existence of these tradeoffs in .</p>

<p> The second one, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7552278/?reload=true">published in IEEE</a>, proposes a method to strike the optimal balance between privacy and utility.</p>

<p> This work is joint with <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/waldo">Jim Waldo</a> and <a href="https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/people/joseph-k-blitzstein">Joe Blitzstein</a> at Harvard.</p>
