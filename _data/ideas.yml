  - title: Better use of space (buildings are only used half the time).
    entry: <p>Office buildings are used during the day; residential homes are used at night. That means that at any given time, either a person's workspace or their home is being used. Can we make a more efficient use of this space by combining both? Making an office space that can convert into a home at night, perhaps with parts of each of these spaces that remain private (e.g. places with valuables.)</p> <p>PROS&colon; <li>Would halve rent <li>Reduce urban sprawl</p> <p>CONS&colon; <li>Is lack of city space one of our pressing issues right now?
  - title: Organizing complex ideas
    entry: I find that it's hard for me to make interconnections between my ideas because there's no good way for me to put down my thoughts in a coherent manner where things can be connected later.  My dream is to have some map of my thoughts that I can see patterns in post-hoc. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Memex?</a>
  - title: Improved peer-to-peer selling/lending services, (i.e. eBay improved)
    entry: eBay doesn't work that well for some things right now&colon; <ul><li>Large items that it would cost a lot to ship <li>Shoes and clothing where the fit matters a lot <li>Low-worth items </ul> but a lot of my items fit into these exact categories. I have been envisioning local warehouses where people can long-term store their stuff (e.g. a pair of shoes they don't want anymore) that would be paired with an online searchable database (like eBay).  Then, a customer can come in to the warehouse and ask to see a certain item, and then pay the attendant to carry it out right then.  Would only work locally.
  - title: Helping people find what they want to work on
    entry: <p>It strikes me that the world could be a happier, more connected place if more people were working on what they want to work on. Possible methods &colon; more unpaid internships, more shadowing days for companies, rotation programs where one can see what many different occupations are like starting in high school or early college
  - title: Closer communities of people
    entry: This is one of my biggest asks about the world.
  - title: Making it easier to learn about topics in depth
    entry: The Internet is a good place to learn about many topics shallowly, largely due to the "news feed" and aggregate news websites. But it's hard to learn about a topic in depth.  Often it feels like there are a goodfew starting websites (Wikipedia, Quora, Reddit) and then in-depth topics (journal papers, technical articles), but not too much in between.
