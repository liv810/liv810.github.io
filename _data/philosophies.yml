  - title: Higher percentage of life-changing experiences.
    entry: Most of life is performed out of routine, but one can know oneself a lot deeper by experiencing challenges that force oneself to new brinks.
  - title: Publicly sharing ideas and thoughts is highly beneficial.
    entry: It forces you to take a position (which you can later modify), and it gives people something to work off in terms of who you are.
  - title: Life philosophies should be symmetric.
    entry: <p> I once had a philosophy that, during conversations with others, I should prioritize learning about the other person.  This stemmed from a belief that I spend all day with myself and in my own head; I'm a lot more likely to learn from another person's experience than to recount my own stories for the 10th time.</p><p>But, this has been one of my less successful philosophies, likely due to its asymmetry.  If everyone I interacted with did this, then nobody would ever be talking about anything important to themselves, only guessing what's important to the other.</p><p>A lot of times, a connection *does* depend on a shared energy channel between two people, and that's not possible when one of them isn't being open and sharing about their own.</p><p>This actually nicely ties back to a Kantian viewpoint as in his categorial imperative ("Act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.")</p>
  - title: One way to add value in the world is to ensure demand for a risky decision.
    entry: Telling someone something like "If you started a company, I'd invest in it" can be a great way to produce value.  It de-risks what would otherwise be a risky decision for them.
  - title: Distrust short statements.
    entry: Especially adages and proverbs that seem all-too-obvious upon first read. They tend to be "good and fuzzy feeling" but not have much discriminatory power.
