A brief history of time:
<img src="images/timeline.png" alt="Life Timeline" style="width:100%">

This website is inspired by my Wunderlist, which I use to keep track of my to-dos but also my thoughts and ideas, and I've realized has become quite a good description of who I am.

One of my most fundamental curiosities is what happens when we challenge our basic assumptions.
- What if we were not constrained by expressing ideas in time and space?
- What if humans have more than five senses?
- What if a "minute" had been defined as 90 seconds?
- What if plants truly feel pain?

These questions remind us that the frameworks in which we work are neither fixed nor correct.

As a result, I enjoy observing myself and understanding my own frameworks. Which of them have I adopted by choice, versus by default?

Some projects that fit this paradigm of changing how we think:
- how we may make money <a href="https://basicincome.ycr.org/">(basic income)</a>
- feeding ourselves on the go <a href="https://soylent.com/">(Soylent)</a>
