title: About Me

This website is inspired by my Wunderlist, which I use to keep track of my to-dos but also my thoughts and ideas, and I've realized has become quite a good description of who I am.

One of my most fundamental curiosities is what happens when we challenge the basic frameworks that we subscribe to.  Some examples:
- What if we changed the unit of time from a minute to, say, 1.5 minutes? Would we get more or less productive?
- What if social norms didn't encourage skewed distributions of how we spend our time? Currently we spend probably 90% of our time with a few people, what if that was spread out more? Would we be happier or less happy?
- What if we were not constrained by expressing ideas in time and space?

As a result, I enjoy observing myself and understanding my own frameworks. Which of them have I adopted by choice, versus by default?

Some projects that I don't know much about but fit this paradigm of changing how we think about ____:
- the role that cities play in our lives: <a href="https://cities.ycr.org/">https://cities.ycr.org/</a>
- how we may make money: <a href="https://basicincome.ycr.org/">https://basicincome.ycr.org/</a>
- feeding ourselves on the go: <a href="https://soylent.com/">https://soylent.com/</a>
