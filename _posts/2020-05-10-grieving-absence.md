I’ve often tried to grieve my mom in the ways that I see other people grieve, but it has never felt quite right.  So much public grieving centers around memories: a social media post recounting memories, or rituals around the person’s favorite things.  But how can you grieve when you never even knew the person fully? How can this feel genuine when the memories are distant, and were cemented in a time when you still had so much to learn about each other?

I’ve come to realize that I’ve been trying to grieve an _absence_ how others are grieving their _losses_.  But the grief that resides in me is of a different flavor than a loss.  The pain of a loss is often caused by the fact that _something that once was will never be again_. Adapting to a new reality without that person can be very hard.

But for me, the grief comes from _never even having been able to know my mom fully in the first place_.  This comes with pain of lost opportunities.  It's hard even to enumerate: there are so many forms they could have taken.  Maybe it’s the lost heart-to-heart conversations, or maybe it’s the lost mother-daughter connections over a first makeup kit or boyfriend or period.  Or maybe it’s just that I’ll never quite know that incredible, full-hearted woman that so many people describe to me as being my mother.

I haven’t wanted to accept it, but the way forward in grieving is not to try to memorialize my mom.  I’ve tried this before — having friends of mine translate from Chinese some of my mom’s writings, or looking through photo albums and trying to piece together a coherent history in my head.  These stories are always going to be external to my experience, and taken from contexts that I don’t know.

The solution, instead, is to focus on my own healing.  To focus on _myself_ when it is _Mom_ who lost a painful battle to cancer, and who lost her life decades too early — I’ve subconsciously rejected it for years as being too selfish.  Maybe even too cliché.  But this is what all healing is about, no matter whether the healing surrounds an absence or a loss.  Rituals themselves help the _survivors_ of a loss cope with what is lost; and I too must focus on healing the holes that remain in me from losing the incredible person that is my mom.

Happy Mother’s Day, Mommy. I love you.
